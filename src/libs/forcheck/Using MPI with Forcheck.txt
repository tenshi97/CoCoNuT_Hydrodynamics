MPI interface for Forcheck

1. Introduction
MPI is a C library. The Fortran binding issues are described at the MPI site.
When analyzing a Fortran program which references MPI library procedures with Forcheck
Forcheck will report the differences in argument type for choice arguments and differences
in shape and rank for assumed size arrays.
By applying the supplied Forcheck library with the MPI module containing MPI constants and 
MPI-2 procedure interfaces you can avoid these messages.

2. Prerequisites
- You need Forcheck 14.0.03 or later and MPI.flb

3. Usage
- Reference the MPI module in each program unit which references MPI procedures and rises
Forcheck errors:
  USE MPI
- Include the library MPI.flb in the analysis.

4. Analysing mpi.f90
When you do not use the supplied library file MPI.flb but analyse mpi.f90, you need to
enable Fortran extensions 69 and 273 in the configuration file. This enables the [PLURI] Forcheck
attribute and the CLASS type.
